### Project description
A lot of endeavours have already been devoted to NLP text summarization techniques, and abstractive methods have proved to be more proficient in generating human-like sentences. At the same time, GANs has been enjoying considerable success in the area of real-valued data such as an image generation. Recently, researchers have begun to come up with ideas on how to overcome various obstacles during training GAN models for discrete data, though not a lot of work seemed to be directly dedicated to the text summarization itself. We, therefore, would like to pursue to tackle the issue of text summarization using the GAN techniques inspired by sources enlisted below.
